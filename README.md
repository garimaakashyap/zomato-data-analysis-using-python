# 📊 Zomato Data Analysis Using Python

Welcome to my data analysis project focused on Zomato, one of India's leading food delivery platforms. This project uses Python to explore customer behavior, restaurant ratings, and ordering patterns based on a real-world dataset. The goal is to extract actionable insights through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization.
